# M5Stack_WifiScanner

Simple wifi scanner / wifi channel analyser written with that awfully tedius visual programming tool, [M5Stack Flow](https://flow.m5stack.com/).

## How to use
1. Navigate to https://flow.m5stack.com/
1. Select your M5Stack device and enter the API key
1. Click the Open icon in the top right (Looks like a folder)
1. Open the file
1. Press Run in the bottom right

*Note* - I couldn't get the file open working in Firefox, but it was fine in Chrome, so maybe try that if you're having trouble.
